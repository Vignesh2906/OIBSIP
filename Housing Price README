# Housing Price Prediction – Linear Regression

This project involves data cleaning, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), and building a simple Linear Regression model to predict housing prices using a Kaggle dataset.
It was implemented using Python in Google Colab.

---

## Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the raw housing dataset
- Explore data patterns using visualizations
- Build a basic regression model to predict house prices
- Evaluate model accuracy using metrics like R² and RMSE

---

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python (Google Colab)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## Dataset Info

- **Source:** [Kaggle Housing Price Prediction ( Linear Regression )]((https://www.kaggle.com/code/ashydv/housing-price-prediction-linear-regression))
- **Columns:** area_type, availability, location, size, society, total_sqft, bath, balcony, price

---

## Data Cleaning Steps

- Removed columns like society and availability
- Extracted numerical values from size (e.g., BHK from "2 BHK")
- Converted total_sqft ranges to average values
- Handled missing/null values
- Removed outliers (e.g., unusual square feet or BHK combinations)

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Here are some of the questions we explored:

- How does price vary by area type or number of bedrooms?
- What is the distribution of square footage, bathrooms, and prices?
- Are there outliers in pricing or area?
- Which features are strongly correlated with price?

### Visualizations Used:

- Histograms
- Pairplots
- Correlation heatmap
- Boxplots
- Countplots
- Pie charts
- Regression plots

_.All plots are available in the notebook._

### Model Building:

- Applied One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Trained a Linear Regression model 
- Generated predictions on the test set

### Model Evaluation:

- R² Score: ~0.62 → Moderate performance
- RMSE: 0.096
- Residual Plot shows a fairly balanced spread
- Predicted vs Actual Plot helps visualize prediction accuracy

## Key Insights

- Square footage, number of BHKs, and bathrooms positively impact price
- Most homes are 2–3 BHK and priced under ₹100 Lakhs
- Area type and location have varying influence on pricing
- Linear Regression provides a baseline model, but more advanced models could improve accuracy
